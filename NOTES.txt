- attributes defined for classes aren't supported in IUS
  * use class variables tagged with attributes (which do seem to be supported) instead
  * it isn't possible to merely tag something about a class, only to define key/value pairs

- need to be careful when looping over all variables in search of attributes, as these aren't
  supported for all variable types
  * need to handle unsupported in an elegant way in 'reflection', with parameters or something
  * user code should use these parameters, for example, to avoid calling functions where they would
    fail

- need to support more than just 'int'
  * 'int unsigned' and 'bit' should be sufficient, though

- provide a more 'OOP' interface in Python instead of just dictionaries
